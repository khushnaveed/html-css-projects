          It's best to use IDs when to uniquely identify a single element within
          a document.
        </p>
        <p id="id-example">
          Some example IDs include semantic IDs, unique identifiers and lower
          case with hyphens.

          It's best to use classes when when you want to apply the same styling
          to multiple elements across your HTML document.
        </p>
        <p id="class-example">
          Some example classes include basic styling classes(buttons, links),
          component classes(card,navbar) and grid and layout classes.
